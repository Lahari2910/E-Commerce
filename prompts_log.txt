Prompts used for generating code in this project (full instructions from the user):

1. "Generate 5 synthetic e-commerce dataset files in CSV format. 
Each file should contain realistic sample data, with appropriate datatypes and relational consistency.
Files to generate:
1. customers.csv  
   Columns:
   - customer_id (unique, integer)
   - name
   - email
   - phone
   - created_at (date)
   - city
   - state
2. products.csv  
   Columns:
   - product_id (unique)
   - product_name
   - category
   - price
   - in_stock (boolean)
   - added_at (date)
3. orders.csv  
   Columns:
   - order_id (unique)
   - customer_id (must match customers.csv)
   - order_date
   - total_amount
   - payment_method (UPI, Card, COD)
   - order_status (Delivered, Cancelled, Processing)
4. order_items.csv  
   Columns:
   - item_id (unique)
   - order_id (must match orders.csv)
   - product_id (must match products.csv)
   - quantity
   - item_price
5. reviews.csv  
   Columns:
   - review_id (unique)
   - customer_id (matches customers.csv)
   - product_id (matches products.csv)
   - rating (1–5)
   - comment
   - review_date
Additional instructions:
- Generate around 20-50 rows per file.
- Ensure foreign keys are consistent across files.
- Use realistic values (names, categories, Indian cities, etc.).
- Save each file in CSV format in the “/data” folder of the workspace.
Ignore all shell commands. Directly generate the 5 CSV files with synthetic ecommerce data and save them in a folder named data. Don’t check directories."

2. "I have 5 CSV files inside a folder called “data” (customers, products, orders, order_items, reviews).
I want to ingest all these files into an SQLite database.
Create a new SQLite database file named “ecom.db” in the workspace.
Then write the code to:
1. Create tables for each CSV with the correct schema
2. Load the CSV data into those tables
3. Make sure the foreign key relationships are enabled (customer_id, product_id, order_id)
4. If any table already exists, drop and recreate it
5. After loading, print a simple count of rows from each table to confirm everything is inserted properly
Use Python (sqlite3 + pandas) or any approach you prefer, but keep the code simple and clean."

3. "I have an SQLite database (ecom.db) with the following tables: customers, products, orders, order_items, and reviews.
Write an SQL query that joins multiple tables together and produces a meaningful output. 
The output should show:
- order_id
- customer_name
- product_name
- quantity
- item_price
- total_amount (from orders table)
- order_date
- city (from customers)
- category (from products)
Use proper JOINs between:
orders → customers  
orders → order_items  
order_items → products  
Also include an ORDER BY on order_date (latest first).
After writing the query, also run it against the loaded database so I can see a sample output."
